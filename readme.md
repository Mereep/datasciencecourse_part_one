**Notes**
Just a repository for me to sync my work for a deep learning course at udemy. 
[https://www.udemy.com/artificial-intelligence-reinforcement-learning-in-python]

This is a public repository for anyone that stumples upon. Be aware, that the stuff here
is in no means connected to the author and in no means an example how-to. 

It is just for my learning purposes.
